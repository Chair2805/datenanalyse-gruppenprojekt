# 1.1.Data Leakage and biases 
### Tasks: 
*1.1.1- In the summary above, you’ll notice that they perform a regression of their engineered
features against UPDRS score. They then predict UPDRS score to define a measure called
NQI. They then use NQI as a feature to classify Parkinson’s vs Healthy. Something seems
fishy here. Discuss this for no more than a paragraph (hint: this might be a form of data
leakage).
1.1.2- Think carefully about the tapping dataset. Can you imagine any biases that might
creep into our dataset? For example, if a patient has Parkinson’s disease, they might use a
computer less (because the disease prevents them), and as such the differences in typing
might be a training effect rather than a disease effect. Discuss this for no more than two
paragraphs (you can use bullet points).*
